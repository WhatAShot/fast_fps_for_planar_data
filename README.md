# Fast farthest point sampling(fps) for planar data
Fast farthest point sampling(fps) for planar data (2D data); ~40x faster than vanilla fps (in some experimental setting)
Fast online fps for planar data (2D data); ~80x faster than vanilla fps (in some experimental setting)

Wanted packages:
```
- time
- pytorch
- functools
- warnings
- math
- matplotlib
```

Run demo:
```
python3 fps.py
```
